# haskell-unicode-snippets package

A collection of snippets for substituting Haskell base library operators into their unicode equivalents.

This package is intended to be used in conjunction with [language-hakell][] which provides snippets for Haskell builtin unicode symbols.

It also has snippets for the greek lower-case alphabet which is mostly parallel to the english alphabet with some substitution to map similar sounding and looking letters to each other. For an exact mapping refer to the snippets section in the settings of this module.

## Requirements

To actually use the symbols generated by the snippets you'll have to import the appropriate modules from [base-unicode-symbols][].
